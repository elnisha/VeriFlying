# SCAI first meeting (14 October 2025)
- AI competition -> dev a model based on the phrase "when pigs fly".
- Need labelled data -> find online.
- Also important to look at the format of the data (csv best). 
- Regression vs Classification:
    - Regression -> predict value
    - Classification -> predict category

- Really important to choose a good dataset. Large, consider form(at), and the model output. 

### Ideas 
- __Classifier for flying/non-flying animals__ -> "our model will fail when pigs fly"
- Fish species classifier -> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sripaadsrinivasan/fish-species-image-data 

## Flying/NonFlying classifier neural network
TASKS: 
- [ ] Install pytorch
- [ ] Find a good dataset
- [ ] Set up github and collab environments

# SCAI second meeting (21 October 2025)

___PYTORCH:___
- End result is a Pytorch tensor. -> `import torch`. 
- Dataset slicing in pytorch is a bit weird -> LLM. 
- we'll use `pandas` -> read the csv directly into pytorch.


---

- _Train loop_ -> use adam as an optimizer. 
- Example code seen on the 4th of nov. in `example_code.py` 
- Notes on example code:
    - if we have classification, the number of final outputs depends on the number of classes to predict. Where the number of final outputs is the last number of the last layer. 
    - Layer syntax --> `self.layer_name = nn.Linear(num of input, num of output)`.
    - the num. of inputs of layer i+1 has to equal the num. of outputs of layer i.
